## HOW TO ACCESS & INTSALL

To download the files, click on the green "code" button, and once this is done, you just have to unzip them.
To access the repository, 

[https://github.com/Elicue/PORTFOLIO](https://github.com/Elicue/PORTFOLIO)

then you can download the files, and once this is done, you just have to unzip them.

Or you can just clone the git project.

## **DEPLOY**

To deploy the site,  (you must already have a Repository with your project) you first have to go  through Vercel [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com/)
 , after you must link it to your Github account, and then your Repository to Vercel, and finally to activate Checkly.

## ZAPIER

I then used Zapier to create a connection between Github and discord, to send a message to each new commit.
